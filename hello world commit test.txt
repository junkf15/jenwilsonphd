Hello World
This is my first file commit from windows to github
I'm testing to see if the ssh keys have been loaded corectly
I'm also going through the process of commiting a new file to a git repo for the first time
this is for my MIT DevOps class

Steps followed:
created github account junkf15 with my standard password
created source code repo called jenwilsonphd, included readme file and index.html
installed git CLI on local machiene
git config --global user.name 'junkf15'
git config --global user.email junkf15@gmail.com
generated ssh keys in git using:
ssh-keygen
used defaults and did not set a passphrase
inspected key in the CLI using:
cat ~/.ssh.id_rsa.pub
copied the key from ssh to the end
pasted the key into the git hub ssh key and named it windows vm key
then created a dev directory
then cloned the repo from github using 
git clone git@github.com:junkf15/jenwilsonphd.git
entered into the jenwilsonphd folder
used the windows file folder to create a hello world.txt file
opened it and added some text
saved it
in the git bash CLI used
git status
file name was red
used add
git add.
checked git status
file name was green
committed the file using
git commit -m 'added test'
successful, then used 
git push
went back to github and checked the status of the file
successful
as a review, I added this test and tried again.
